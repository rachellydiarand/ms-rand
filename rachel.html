So, I'm kinda getting into morbid mode this evening.  Obviously my health has taken a hit the last two years.  Not sure how fatal all this is.  It's certainly got me scared.<br>
<br>
And of course, if you have been following me, I've been doing some huge life review and critiqueing all my relationships is part of that.  The most fulfilling relationships were the older women.  Patty, Cynthia and Adrianna.  All three of them had something slightly different about them.  Adrianna had the psychology edge.  Patty was a cool sci-fi type person.  Cynthia spoke without nouns and was fiercely loyal.<br>
<br>
My memory of it all is that it was dang cool to have an older retired person as a partner.  There is a sense of freedom with them.  They are at the end of their life and enjoy being with a hot younger partner.  It felt like a win-win each time.<br>
<br>

I'm almost 55 years old, I'm single, and I'm a US Presdential candidate.  Or at least close to it.  For a SECOND TIME.<br>
<br>
So, obviously I am in the market for a relationship, but this is the oddest dating situation ever.  Over here, with a female partner, it's a thing of us being at home <span class="highlight">both wearing bikinis</span> and stuff like that.  I've got my eye on this look, FOR ME.  Of course I'm attracted to her too!<br>
<br>
So there is that.<br>
<br>
Also in my evolving quest for a partner/lover, it's a great idea for her/you to be a translator.  Just a sexy translator by my side.  Yes, that would work well.  So if you are OK with these parameters, you may be on a smaller interest list than you think you are.  I'm a musician, so obviously I am an attraction and you are an attraction and attractions typical just attract and people come in the front door.  So, that makes dating me difficult.  The meeting me ice breaker.  But you are in the translator end of the relationship.  So, it's kinda complicated on some levels.  Mix that in with my odd levels of support and secret service.  You being preparred to be under secret service watch for the rest of your life.<br>
<br>
AND a bunch of other stuff.  This isn't exactly the PARTY CIRCUIT, right?<br>
<br>
Air cleared on that, hopefully....<br>

These people....  A theory is that people are making fun of me because of my glasses.  My inability to recognize people.<br>
<br>
<b>Understand this</b>, they have put so many clone type people, look-a-like people in my envirnoment over many decades, but especially the last couple years, it's painful torture like that.  I'm crazy introverted anyway.<br>
<br>
Glasses are cool.  I can't work without them.  These plastic glasses are like the worst glasses I ever had, but they are political.  The Navy BCD (birth control glasses).  You know, population reduction.  The DEATH AFTER BIRTH bill.  We need to reduce population.  And who wants to give up sex?  We do our best, right?  With the times WE LIVE IN.  The times that we were born into.<br>
<br>
The only real sin in some ways was humanity taking all this stuff from the Earth and using it up.  I'm sure it was the best option.  I didn't make that choice!  None of us did!<br>
<br>
<br>
It's ok, right?<br>

So, I was living with and having sex with Adrianna in late 2001 and onward.  She was over 30 years older than me.  She was amazing!  Petite.  From Holland with a great accent!  Saw Pink Floyd in the 1960's.  Went to college at the Church of Scientology in England for 5 years.<br>
<br>
I told her that I loved her after a while.  She responded "You don't love me.  How could you love me?"  I just kind of shrugged my shoulders.  I suppose she needed to cut off sex and make things more professional.  It must have been amazing to watch me doing all those long work days there.  Creating music.  Studying programming and math.<br>
<br>
Thinking of her now, my love is super strong for her.  Amazing is amazing.  I've had two musician wives.  Just realized now.  The two women I officially married, and divorced, were both musicians.  We never played any music together at home.  I played with Ann in the Memphis Jazz Orchestra, and work in the Navy.  I'm very apprehensive of having a musician for a partner again.<br>
<br>
In a relationship, I'm looking for a good home life.  It's crazy risky with me I suppose.  I have no money at all.  In this terrible situation of possibly having to buy bottled water at the store, empty it at home and then returen the bottles to get shaving gel and razors.  Why is the world so stingy?  I don't get it at all.<br>
<br>
But you know, also completely on top of the world.  I just finished transcribing Bob Mintzer's <a href="https://www.yellowjackets.com/store-page/p/time-squared-cd"><i>New Rochelle</i></a>.  I did that in 1997 but didn't write it down.  Now practicing it on keyboard and 6 string bass.  Crazy cool stuff!<br></div>

The next round of clothing I'm interested in purchasing: <a href="culture.html">Rachel's Clothing</a><br>
<br>
That's the kind of thing I'll be wearing as president, senator, on the streets, in my house.<br>

Look, I'm trying to get people to understand me because I'm likely way different than the majority of people.
<br>

<br>
Most people enjoy going to music concerts, right?  Most people enjoy watching sports.  Right?  Well, I don't enjoy either of those activities.  It's strange that I'm a musician and don't enjoy going to concerts, but it's totally true.  I enjoyed seeing Sting once.  Like really enjoyed him and the light show and all that.  Of course I want him and Victor Wooten to get paid.
<br>

<br>
It's just cultural with me.
<br>

<br>
It's not fair to say that I'm 100% business because it's actually not true.  I'm simply introverted.  I have a solitary Zen practice.  I play solo music and record it.  I enjoy improvised random performing around town, but all in all, I'd rather be in my studio.
<br>

<br>
I'd enjoy a gig at a coffee shop.  Like a 100% residency where I can live at the coffee shop essentially and perform there randomly as their only musician.  I'm scared to even ask though because that is just so dang abnormal.  right?  right?  This is all abnormal, right?
<br>

<br>
Q: Does the president live and work at the White House?
<br>

I have some big connection with Sting, formerly with the band The Police.
<br>

<br>
Hey, I am not Sting.  If I understand this correctly, he was born and raised in New Castle England in an Irish Catholic family.  His mother played piano and his other relatives played music too.
<br>

<br>
I'm more like Geddy Lee on those fronts.  His family was not musical.  He was raised in a Jewish family and now says that he is "An atheist and culturally Jewish".
<br>

<br>
Sting says that he is an agnostic.
<br>

<br>
I say that I "was raised in a sober atheist environment and adopted Zen as my way of life".
<br>

<br>
My family did not play any significant music.  Mom played enough piano to give me a good start when I was 6 years old or so.  My household was crazy non-advertising.  No music in the car or the house.  Commercials always muted on the TV.  No printing on shirts.  I mean they really avoided advertising.  And running for president has a massive advertising edge to it.

<b>I appreciate religious people.</b>  I really do.
<br>

<br>
I even have much in common with them.  I really do.
<br>

<br>
But I'm not a part of any church.  I'm not a part of the Buddhist community.  I'm kind of a zen monk.  A zen guru.  I grew up in a strictly sober, atheist household.  I adopted Zen as my religion in high school.  It was based on half lotus meditation, some special old jazz records like Joe Henderson's <i>Black Narcissus</i>.  And Yogananda's book <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i>.  It was a big deal to me in high school.  A really big deal.  He talked about meditation sessions in a master apprentice kind of way.  Levetation and other things.  Not really yoga.  It was half lotus mediation and relationships very much like private music instructors.  Not the kind of music lessons in a mass produced music shop.  right?
<br>

<br>
I'm a very spiritual woman.  The JJ Johnson songs Blue Nun and Azure.  I played those on my trombone daily all through the 1990's as part of my hour and a half warm-up.
<br>

<br>
Alan Watts' writing is also very important to my way of life as are Robert Pirsig's two books.  And Grace Lee Whitney's book <i>My Tour of the Galaxy</i>.  Geddy Lee's <i>My Effin' Life</i>.  DeForest Kelly's <i>From Sawdust to Stardust</i>.

The best way to describe myself is as a transwoman homemaker.  I don't have children and I don't want to have children.  That makes things difficult politically, but it makes sense that we need to massively draw down population.  Like not all the way of course, but yeah, we need to be intentional about this.
<br>

<br>
Piling the kids and dog into the van on a misty Saturday morning for the kids soccer game.  Standing on the sideline in a lovely warm sweater or coat.  Soaking up the atmosphere.  Men out on the field doing their coaching thing or whatever they do.  Kids running around doing their thing.
<br>

<br>
On most mornings, a brisk bicycle ride.  Morning shopping once a week.  An occasional dinner out with friends in the late afternoon before that dinner crowd comes.
<br>

<br>
I'm into intimacy.  I'm into being sober.  You may see me as a party person.  I've certainly done some drugs and alcohol in my life, but it was pretty dang meditation based for me and I concentrate WAY MORE on work than getting high.  I've been mostly sober for almost a quarter century too.  So don't get the idea from the zen play transwoman look I have that I'm just some druggy 'cause I'm simply not.
<br>

<br>
<b>And above all</b>, don't get the idea that I'm going to stop wearing nice dresses and all that.  That's a no go on detransition to be president or hold any position in life.  Not into that.  That is seperation of culture and state.  <u>Just hands off my culture people.</u>

I'm feeling better this morning though.  So, my culture....
<br>

<br>
Look, there is home then work then third places.  SOME people enjoy bars and concerts.  Some people enjoy going to sporting events.  I assum Barak Obama enjoys sporting events.  Trump is into golfing.  I'm a bicyclist.
<br>

<br>
I'm a musician too, but I don't like concerts and bars.  I just don't.
<br>

<br>
I'm ok with people calling me gay.  That's descriptive enough for me to get on board with.  I'm a transwoman.  I don't know if transwomen are the new gay people or not, but I'm not an "A Lister" type of person.  I'm a NW geek.  I'm a writer.  I enjoy composing music.  Little melody fragments.  Feel free to latch onto some of my fragments.
<br></div>

<div class='post'>
<h4>2025-12-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;05:42:10 AM</h4>
So, I am transfeminine.  I'm single, divorced, widowed.  A single presidential candidate, so that just adds to the stress of all of this.  How do you find a partner as a presidential candidate with 5 cents in her pocket?  It's absolute insanity for me.
<br>

<br>
Look my life/career journey has been intense.  3 years of living in cars and a full year on the streets studying math.  NO ONE was willing to be by my side doing that work.  No one believed in me that much.  And still, people do not seem to believe in me enough to take a chance and help me out.  To really believe in me.  Be by my side.  Loving, helping.
<br>

<br>
And then I get guilted for "doing it all myself".
<br>

<br>
<b>Hey, I'm not really mad about this stuff.</b> But it is triggering.  It can trigger hate.  I can lash out when I have no resources.

Good morning!  I'm making this page as an attempt to keep most of MY CULTURE off of the main political pages and the running blog.
