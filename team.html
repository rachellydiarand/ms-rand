<span class="highlight"><b>About the Research Assistant postion....</b></span><br>
<br>
This is becoming critical to my political work.  You'll essentially be taking ownership of my library of research.  Let's just say it is currently at 10,000 images and growing by 50+ a day.<br>
<br>
You'll need to apply whatever you need to do to sort those images so that when I ask for one, you know what I'm talking about and can get to it quickly so that I am not stuck looking for an image for 20 minutes because when I do that, half the time I can't even find it and then I have other thoughts coming in and I have to jot those down and that brings up more research.<br>
<br>
It's just becoming a mess like that.  I really, really need this position filled.  <b><u>This position can be remote.</u></b>  I'll have to hand off over a gigabyte of images.  We'll need some drop box thing or some other way to coordinate that.  I like the idea of working in the same space, like we are prepping to go to the White House or pretend working on Air Force One.  But I just need this position filled to do this work whether I am successful at making it to the presidency or not.  I'm going to be doing this work anyway and want someone working with me who wants to work with me.<br>
<br>
Now that I'm thinking about all this, you'll essentially be on call with this, so it's best for someone who isn't like going out with friends all the time.  It's not like an 8 to 5 thing as I work all hours of the day and night.  I'd probably send you a text and hope that you'll respond quickly.  It's OK if you miss a text once in a while, but you'll need to be pretty responsive because my ideas do not conform to any timetable.  I often communicated with my clients at 5am with my software business, so it's not all that unusual.  Not that it was a requirement in <b>THAT GIG</b>.  They were just morning people like me, but in <u>this gig</u> it pretty much is a requirement to be on call like that.  This is presidential work, right?  Not a shift at 7-11.<br>

I know my campaign is radical, but it does make sense, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
I'm still looking for someone to <b>take charge of HR and my campaign</b>.  That position will bring on people mostly to do campaign activities.  I can guide campaign activities, but I want to be mostly hands off on it.  I'll need to see tangible results in my community and in the media to keep people on.  Trying to get to that point where I can access the public presidential fund.  It requires a minimum of a total of $100,000 in contributions spread across 20 different US States.<br>
<br>
Also looking for my <b>Research Assistant</b>.  I'm drowning in work over here.  Nearly 10,000 research images that need to be categorized and analyzed.<br>
<br>
I'm actually fine with these positions being done from home.  I have ways to verify that you are getting your job done.  I'm offering USDA/SNAP benefits verification for volunteering.  You may think that is crazy, but that is absolutely in line with my politics about the end of capitalism.  It's a real thing folks.<br>
<br>
Step up and make a difference.  Work with me!  We'll have a blast doing this together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Look, I don't know anything about social networking.  Like nothing at all.  My family was so small and then they all died.  Or they are lying to me.  Either way, they are all dead to me.  My musician friends can't be of much help.  I haven't talked with them in decades anyway.  No idea how to find them.  right?  reach out.  I assume your email will get through.  Forget my glasses or whatever the media is telling you about google non-sense.  These politics are likely completely true.  What have you got to lose?  Let's go on this adventure.  Yeah, it's kind of risky.  Do you think I know a thing or two about risk?<br>
