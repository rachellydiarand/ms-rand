I know my campaign is radical, but it does make sense, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
I'm still looking for someone to <b>take charge of HR and my campaign</b>.  That position will bring on people mostly to do campaign activities.  I can guide campaign activities, but I want to be mostly hands off on it.  I'll need to see tangible results in my community and in the media to keep people on.  Trying to get to that point where I can access the public presidential fund.  It requires a minimum of a total of $100,000 in contributions spread across 20 different US States.<br>
<br>
Also looking for my <b>Research Assistant</b>.  I'm drowning in work over here.  Nearly 10,000 research images that need to be categorized and analyzed.<br>
<br>
I'm actually fine with these positions being done from home.  I have ways to verify that you are getting your job done.  I'm offering USDA/SNAP benefits verification for volunteering.  You may think that is crazy, but that is absolutely in line with my politics about the end of capitalism.  It's a real thing folks.<br>
<br>
Step up and make a difference.  Work with me!  We'll have a blast doing this together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Look, I don't know anything about social networking.  Like nothing at all.  My family was so small and then they all died.  Or they are lying to me.  Either way, they are all dead to me.  My musician friends can't be of much help.  I haven't talked with them in decades anyway.  No idea how to find them.  right?  reach out.  I assume your email will get through.  Forget my glasses or whatever the media is telling you about google non-sense.  These politics are likely completely true.  What have you got to lose?  Let's go on this adventure.  Yeah, it's kind of risky.  Do you think I know a thing or two about risk?<br>
