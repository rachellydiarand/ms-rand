Obviously I'm just like every other presidential candidate around the world.  If I can't even produce a hit singer/songwriter song I simply haven't made the grade to be president.
<br>

<br>

I don't know how many people this will be a culture shock for, but my parents mostly treated my brother and I like adults.  Like at a young age, maybe 8 years old for me and 6 for my brother, or like 10 and 8, my parents would tell us "We're going out to dinner.  We'll see you in a couple hours."
<br></div>

<div class='post'>
<h4>2026-02-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;04:51:10 AM</h4>
I don't like telling people what to do, especially in my home.  My parents rarely told me what to do.
<br>

<br>
Cynthia would sweep and I'd be like, wow, the paths are all clean and I didn't do it.  That's nice.
<br>

<br>
Washing machines and dryers.  Refrigerators.  Ovens and dishwashers.  Microwaves.  My hunch is that in many places, the amount of freshwater isn't the biggest problem.  Our problems may mainly be tire rubber.  Condoms.  That kind of thing.  It could also be coal which is our ability to process metal.  To get new metal.  Something like those things will bring industrialism to a close.  And we'll likely want to hang onto washers and dryers the most.
<br>

<br>
But of course there is a bunch of other stuff.  Yard equipment is kind of a low priority.  I enjoy the <i>Back to the Future</i> quote, at the very end:
<br>

<br>
"Roads?  Where we're going, we don't need roads."
<br>

<br>
Obviously a mountain bike reference.  I've been watching the movie <i>WarGames</i> lately.  I think it is Juanin Clay who plays John Mittrick's assistent who I've been focusing on.  I think she does an excellent job in that movie!  She kind of brings the adult ridiculous/zanny vibe to the whole movie.  It's what I like about studying these old movies.  That movie would have huge hole in it without her playing that role.
<br>

<br>
It's part of my femininity.  It's like all the men are doing this crazy stuff and the women are kind of saying, well sure, this kinda makes sense but wow, this sure is weird.  The internet says Juanin died at 46 years old and that she lost the <i>Buck Rogers</i> part to Erin Grey.
<br>

<br>
Hopefully I win this election and can hire some people.  I have ton of research type things to do and it's simply too much for one person.  I got a red clipboard and I've got the other half of my bed all covered with papers already.  It's actually working out well like that!

<span class="highlight"><b>Rachel's State of the Union 2026 Response</b> (unedited)</span>
<br>

<br>
I don't know how much this all matters, but how did COVID immigrate to the US?  I always talk about the booming airline industry.  Did they forget to go through the decontamination room when they landed?  That the Star Trek episode, well, that's the one with the little unicorn dog, right?
<br>

<br>
Then he goes on to prescription drugs, right?  OK, I paid for all my dental care and gender care, the counseling and the meds and all that.  For gender transition obviously.  So, how do we pay for health care?
<br>

<br>
How does money work?
<br>

<br>
Well, the average citizen buys health care.  Some work situtations pay more than others.  It's an "insurance" thing for most people for most things.  How much health care are people getting?  You pay insurance to spread the financial risk out over a group.
<br>

<br>
OK, here's my talking point....
<br>

<br>
I start out adult life riding my bicycle like 30 miles a day for two years.  My only source of transportation.  And I got a different world view from that.
<br>

<br>
And then in my early 30's, I got another different world view from being on the streets, guarding all those office buildings at night while others went home and then using those plastic bottles in the trash to pee in because I didn't want it on the sidewalk.
<br>

<br>
The pee story, right?  Well, I've got my pads and all....
<br>

<br>
My second wife used to tease me something aweful.  About my rape injury and more.  There were some good times for sure, but yes, a different world view than most people get.
<br>

<br>
The 18 wheeler wreck onto the borders again.  The booming airline industry.  Immigration and the personal vetting of each individual.  Trump talked earlier about legal immigration.  Now he is talking about people that "we" do not want.  OK, legal and illegal.  The difference between living and growing.  Resources and stuff we can't do anymore.  Security.  Ease of transportation.  The monks walking 2,000 miles?  Wow, that sure is a lot.  They said it took about 100 days.  20 miles a day is indeed a lot of walking.
<br>

<br>
Now thinking of walking back from Montana a couple summers ago.  The fear of going on that freeway ramp having no clue how far the next settlement down the road is.  No water.  No money.
<br>

<br>
Thoughts.  I can't say I remember the word "shame" being used in my household growing up.  I guess it is hard to remember, but the culture in my house was different.  I don't rember any training on protecting the family legacy or anything like that.
<br>

<br>
Now ID at the poles.  I guess it makes sense.  We did it like that a long time.  It's a community gathering.  A disease vector, but people are doing that thing all the time here.
<br>

<br>
What are we voting for?  With a drastically reduced amount of natural resources?  It's why I want my campaign to be funded.  So I can get a couple people to work with.  People who are loyal to me and we can brainstorm this from another angle.  Another point of view.  If we drawdown like that, what will democracy mean?  Imagine the rat race being over.  No paycheck to get.  No fuel to get to work.  No work to go to, but the buildings are still there.
<br>

<br>
We could have service sector stuff.  I scratch your back you scratch mine and we'll call it employment and whoever does not participate in back scratching can be ejected from society and look at all the empty buildings in the cold.
<br>

<br>
Not sure how many people know what that perspective feels like.  Trump feels like he is trying to shame me personally now.  He brought up the forced gender transition story.  I'm doing my best to stand up for both sides in this transgender battle.  There are a lot of people in the world.  People of my age were forced on to Ritalin to cope with ADHD.  What was the result of that social medical experiment?  Why was it done?  Did it help or harm?
<br>

<br>
I've researched it before, but it deserves more rounds of research.  It's why I'm asking to be supported.  To get a fairly young researcher working with me because I have low trust in people who have been watching TV and going to college and trusting everything they have been told.  I'm just really zen about these things.
<br>

<br>
I am also not an American flag waver.  I see myself as a more of less, perfect world representative.  It's why I can't latch onto any group for my own.  I can't choose a side.  I'm on the side of human survival?  Food, clothing and shelter.  I believe our litte industrial production game is up.  All I'm hearing is stuff that pertains to a funcitioning capitalist system.  Not saying that there is not awareness up there.
<br>

<br>
I'm certainly not saying we should be soft on immigration.  Defining what saftey and civilization is.  I feel that the habitat of humanity has been built and this is a massively changing world.
<br>

<br>
I just tuned out of this state of the union and I must say that the typical polar divide that I've seen in the past was not present there like I've seen it before.  It could be President Trump's focus on other people's stories of triumph slanted towards a pro-America cheerleading vibe.
<br>

<br>
My point of view is much more serious.  It's not that he isn't serious.  But my style about it and what I feel I have been trained for feels radically different than what I see out in our media.
<br>

<br>
It's serious because we somehow have to get through to our youth that we need a radically smaller generation.  If they can pull that off, things will be good.  We've been doing all these drug things.  Not sure how effective all that is.  Plan B.  The Pill.  IUD.  Condoms.  Yeah, they prevent pregnacy.  I'm just in the kind of evil position of saying we simply need less children and we need to do what it takes to do that.  The politics of that are radically different than what we see in the news.  Or at least what I see in the news because I don't really watch the new all that much.
<br>

<br>
I get my little presidential news feed, right?  Have been for decades.  The scary thing is that all of our devices can be customized to us.  You can see them all working on our personal history and location.
<br>

<br>
OK, I'm not going to edit this and I'll post it up here.  I'm getting tired.  7:30pm now.  I'm not a nighttime person at all.  I made a mess in the parking lot.  People have been messing with me massively.  PUshing my buttons to get me crazy mad and I can only take so much before I explode.  I'm a torture victim.  I interpret it as part of my training.  It's a difficult position to be in.

It appears that the little homeless villages that they built around here are vacant, right?
<br>

<br>
Q: Does this make sense?
<br>

<br>
My heading says that I am a transwoman.  A card carrying Female.  I do not take medications of any kind that I know about.  I use pink shaving gel and razors.  I feminize and relax with Pantyhose.  I'm a US Presidential candidate and would like to show up in congress and the white house in some nice new dresses.
<br>

<br>
If you contribute money to me, I can stop stressing about whatever bills these are.  If you contribute enough and I win the next election, I can buy/rent two motorhomes for the campaign.  One for me and one for my two employees.  We can then hit the road and I can train them.  People do train their employees, right?
<br>

<br>
My written driving test is good through January 2027.  It is understandable that no one would work for me because I have no money.  I'm working the problem, right?  There is no way I'll be able to work any kind of regular job out there and save up enough to pay two employees for any reasonable length of time, right?
<br>

<br>
My new flyer rocks, right?  It's reasonable to want to be paid in cash instead of in hate, right?  I'm sorry if I let you down.  I'm not perfect, right?  I'm sorry if I am continuing to let you down.  I'm doing my best, right?  I can't please everyone.  I may have to fire people in the future.  Woman are people too.

<h4>2026-02-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01:45:16 AM</h4>
My list of former careers does not list SINGER/SONGWRITER.  Just in case you got the wrong idea and are torturing me because of that.  I do consider myself a composer, but it's different.  I'm an improviser.  Formerly professionally.
<br>

<br>
Even though I've played thousands of gigs, on four continents, I hardly know what it is like for an audience to clap for me or to pay to see me.  That's not how my professional music was done.  We played on Beale Street in Memphis every Monday night for $25-$50 a night.  I played 3<sup>rd</sup> trombone.  Howard Lamb took almost all the trombone solos.  Ann dragged me out to the gig.  I wouldn't have gone if it weren't for her.  I would not play that gig again.
<br>

<br>
Because I'm a traditional housewife.  Ann wears the pants in the family, I just iron them.
<br>

<br>
I threw the trash in the laundry room out in the parking lot and dragged the mattress that showed up in our neighborhood to the other side of the street.  I reported this activity to the authorities on their website last week.  I'm sick of people laying all this trash around wherever I show up.
<br>

<br>
I'm simply waiting for election day.  I will never play a concert with people again in my life.
<br>

<br>
The president, me, I'm a solo show only.  If you don't vote for me, I won't get elected.  My best career path other than US Sentate / US President, is to code software from home part time and have someone get the gigs for me because I have no negotiating power with people.
<br>

<br>
If people don't grant you authority, you have no authority over other people.
<br>

<br>
If people actively place trash around you, it causes insanity.
<br>

<br>
I asked the VA to get me some statistics on how many people who are admitted to mental hospitals have no drug or alcohol in their system.  Hopefully I can get a decent response from them.
<br>

<br>
My best friend, Sam Burton, has tortured me mentally for decades.  It causes hate.  He may be severely tortured as well.  Or he may be lying.
<br>

<br>
My brother said he was gang raped for several days when he was in Boston with my uncle when he was 14 years old.  My friends and family said he died on May 20<sup>th</sup> 2021 at the age of 48.  Perhaps from the injuries he sustained from that rape event.  That's what I know about that.
<br>

<br>
My family said that my mom died on February 23<sup>rd</sup> 2018.  After severe character assassination in June 2024, after losing the Democratic Primary, I saw my mother, or someone who looked exactly like her, on a hospital bed in the hall as I was headed out the door.  At Peace Hospital in Vancouver Washington.  As I walked away from that place which felt like it was holding me against my will, the sign said that it was the "Peace Hospital Urology Clinic".
<br>

<br>
The fact is that my family could have been lying to me and manipulating me my whole life.
<br>

<br>
I have no trust in people right now.
<br>

<br>
I'm waiting 84 days until this primary election is over in hopes that people will vote for me.  I feel like I've been trained for something massively important and it isn't a little/big music show.
<br>

<br>
My client, Ron Doctors in Santa Barbara, who I did the computer code for his electric car, took me and Patty to a Wynton Marsalis concert when we showed up in his driveway in our motorhome with the massively leaky power steering fluid.  I was hauling sewage from inside into his bathroom in a 5 gallon bucket.  That Wynton Marsalis show was terrible music.  Wynton did do his little thing to prove that he is a massively talented musician and trumpet player, but it was all lost on me.  The music was terrible.
<br>

<br>
I've been to three Sting concerts.  2017, 2019, 2023.  I will not go to another one.
<br>

<br>
I've been to two RUSH concerts.  1990, 2011.  In 2011, I went with Sam.  It was fairly humiliating for me.  Then Sam inisists that we leave the concert early so we can beat the traffic to go home.  We heard their song The Working Man bouncing out all over the concrete and metal in the parking lot and it sounded pretty good that way.  It was the Presto tour in 1990 or was it 1991?  The one with the rabbits!
<br>

<br>
I had our heavy ass amp rack in the Navy fall down off the US Navy Destroyer onto the liberty boat that me and Barry where on, hooking the strap ends onto the handles of our gear to be hauled up and over the top rail.  It was dark and raining.  The water was rocking the boat a bit.
<br>

<br>
I took two plane flights to see my drummer friend Shaun from the Navy.  From Portland to Florida in like 2010 and 2011.  Both trips were pretty forgettable and I shouldn't have wasted my time and money on that.  Cynthia and I flew to the Sting concert in 2019.  Cynthia was living a fairly upper class lifestyle for a couple decades in Hawaii.  The trip was terrible because of the music and work angle on it.  We shouldn't have gone.  I wanted to just rent a nice hotel room, a hotel with a pool, for us, around town, in an off time during the week so we could enjoy the romance of it.  That would have made both of us much more happy most likely.  I was researching hotels, but I just couldn't figure it out and felt some obligation to go to the Sting concert.  It was terrible.
<br>

<br>
The Sting conert in 2023 was, well, it was something.  Probably half the seats were empty.  I was dressed in my normal stuff.  I mini tube dress, sandal wedge heels.  The older people in front of me were passing baby pictures to eachother on their phones.  I switched seats out of boredom and saw the same thing were I ended up.  Of course I live some radically different life than those people.
<br>

<br>
I believe what I'm involved in is about our bringing industrialism from HIGH gear into LOW gear.  I'm certainly an odd ball candidate.  If I win the election this way, then perhaps the cat will be out of the bag and people will start treating me with the respect that I deserve.  It's not easy doing what I do.  My best course of action until then is likely to just stay out of the public as much as I can because I can't take any more of this hate and trash people leave out there.  I interpret it as Christian hate.  And I lash out at black people because I have been tortured by them several times.  Something about their culture that many of them pass on to their children or something like that makes them excellent torturers.  And that has been part of my training.  It's actually not racist.
<br>

<br>
You can see all kinds of people out in society doing the grunt work.  They likely do that becase they are getting paid.  I have massive problems getting people to pay me no matter what work I do in society.  That's part of my torture training.  How do you get someone to give you your paycheck?  Well, sometimes it's just futile.  You move it from one month to the next month in your budget.  You call them on the phone.  You ask for it in person.  And then after a while, you give up on it and remove it from the budget projections because seeing it there becomes too complicated.
<br>

<br>
I'm good with some business skills.  I'm not all that good at negotiating.  I'm terrible at cold calling, but if I am president, or perhaps win a major election through write in votes, maybe people will talk straight with me?
<br>

<br>
Sorry about all the hate, racial religous or otherwise.  I'm simply doing my job reflecting all this stuff back because I have to do something with it.
<br>

<br>
Please, please don't talk to me about a war half way around the planet.  Get real.  You do not know any more than I do that there is a war half way around the planet.  It's one of the reasons I do not knock on doors as a political candidate.  One of many reasons I do not engage people on the streets one on one about politics.  I can't even get the Army Corps of Engineers to have a meeting with me so I can ask them what their plan is for decomissioning the dams in the US Congressional District that I have run for office in 3x.  If I can't get an answer like that and from that position, then it is irrational for me to talk with any citizen around here about the issue.  WE DO NOT KNOW.
<br>

<br>
Please get a grip on some logic out there people.

<br>

I have not seen a space launch.  It would be easy enough to see a launch like that and believe that it went to space.  Seeing a human return from space would be much more difficult to prove.  The vehicles themselves, almost impossible to prove.

The 250<sup>th</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> of July event this summer may be a thing of launching rockets to the moon, around the world, to put new craters up there.  I'm not going to play a concert that day.  You couldn't pay me or threaten me enough to do that.  It may be the rocket thing.

My review of their Wikipedia pages reveals that there is a lot of passionate work and risky business moves with Ms. Holmes while Rodney's page is almost entirely about his excessive salary.  What did Rodney do for that money at Kroger?  Distribution system upgrades or more efficient processes?  Was it just difficult to keep the daily thing going there?

Is this current ICE action initiated by the President about our engineering systems or is it ethnic cleansing?
<br>

<br>
A Google AI result that I just got suggested that Washington State increses in population by 85,000 people a year.  State population is currently recorded at 8,000,000.  That's a 1% population increase per year.  It said that it was mostly from immigration.  Likely interstate immigration.
<br>

<br>
<div class="indentedDark">
<br>
In 100 years, that increase will double the population of Washington State to 16,000,000.  <b><u>Can the State of Washington increase its water/sewer/electric/gas systems to handle the 100% population increase in the next 100 years?</u></b>

$6,714,111 / 12 candidates = $559,509 per candidate
<br>

<br>
$559,509 / 2.5 years = $223,803 per year per candidate
<br>

<br>
$223,803 - $61,000 (candidates salary) = $162,803 after paying candidates salary
<br>

<br>
$162,803 / 3 = $54,267 per employee per year for 3 full time employees
<br>

<br>
$0 = left over to pay for advertising, for the 12 democractic 2024 presidential candidates if they paid fairly meager salaries to themselves and 3 full time employees for 2.5 years of campaigning.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>Analysis:</b>
<br>
No, $6,714,111 is not a lot of money at all to run almost any kind of business, and is especially poor to be dispersed over 12 US Presidential Candidates out of 14 US Democratic Party Presidential Candidates in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

<b>Q: <i>Are campaign finances really a problem?</i></b>
<br>

<br>
This research that I did indicates that if you exclude Biden and Harris, the <u>other 12 Democratic Party candidates</u> for US President in 2024 raised <span class="highlight"><b><u>$6,714,111</u></b></span>.  Is that a lot of money?  How many people could retire on that amount of money?  3 or 4?  How many people made a living for a few years off of that money?

<b><u>Voters have decisions to make....</u></b>
<br>

<br>
Here in Oregon, Sen. Jeff Merkley is up for re-election and I certainly feel capable of taking him on.  The question for voters is if you want me up there whistleblowing on what our economy and future is really about or if you want Jeff Merkley to continue doing what he is doing up there?  You know I'll be making a huge scene, naturally.  I'm not even on the friggin' ballot, so getting elected as a write in this primary would be a historic event all on its own.  And with all I have done, I don't feel like I have to lift a finger anymore with my campaigning efforts.

Sorry if I seem mean and lash out.  Running on a platform of the end of industrialism with a huge need for population decline is not popular at all.  And I'm pretty dang mellow all things considered.  It's highly likely people are passive aggressively torturing me, and others, to make me a stronger candidate and I really don't understand why that is neccesary.  I do my best each day.

Although I cannot deny that this presidential gig, the commander in chief, leader of the free world gig, has a massive masculine edge to it, I am totally serious that I am authentically, socially, a traditional housewife.
<br>

<br>
Whether I have a submissive, traditional housewife, female partner ( wife ), or a traditional male partner ( husband ), I have made it to a social place of being a traditional housewife.  I am childfree and am remaining childfree.  It makes sense that we need to reduce population massively, hopefully civily.
<br>

<br>
If we have wars in the future, I think it will be more of a civil war with your neighbors than the government putting it on you.  The government may step in to protect people and property to a degree.  I doubt it will get out of hand as long as we can reduce popualtion voluntarily.  It seems pretty serious.
<br>

<br>
I enjoy this fantasy of doing the job of the president.  I am tortured by the concept that people need or want me to play music gigs.  I'm an internet sensation and internet sensations don't need a lot of money.  The people below me and to the side of me are respectful.  I make a ton of sound here, day and night.  Political monolog.  Music in all forms.  Never a single complaint.  With $200/month added, I'll have everything I need to live the rest of my days in peace and harmony.  I have some basic needs and a desire for some somewhat fancy clothing.
<br>

<br>
I'll put it out there.  People writing me in for the US Senate seat in May is my best path forward politically.  without that vote of confidence, I'm simply doing my tranditional housewife at home internet thing.  My home, my place in life, is on the internet.  And that is compatible with the US Presidency.  It makes some sense that some world travel would be in order if I get elected.

I feel that my music, the solo music that I do, was intended to be solo music and complementary to me as an elected politician.  It, me, I'm a show of authenticity on the website.  On your device.  So you can trust that it is me telling you, on a little screen, that we are indeed shutting down industrialism.  Not just in your neighborhood, but everywhere around the world.  And me, authentically sharing the logic, as I have uncovered it, directly to you on those screens.

I, am a TRADITIONAL transwoman housewife.  Yes, that is not traditional in the sense of biologically traditional.  It's a social thing.  Like a woman staying home, cleaning and cooking, child bearing and raising the family.  Support for the man of the household.  The man who goes out into the world, to do the heavy lifting.  Who takes lunch breaks at the bar or pub.  Who socializes during lunch sometimes, with other men, to negotiate business deals.
<br>

<br>
A traditional woman, a transwoman, at home, with limited socializing.  Limited choices on what work to do.  The daily grind.  The happy household.  The singing and cooking.  The singing and sweeping.  The hauling of water.  The taking a lovely afternoon nap when the house is all perfect.  Dreaming of my man coming home in the evening.  Putting on my best dress.  Waiting.  Waiting.

These images are pointing to problems with housing and more importantly, transportation and energy.
<br>

<br>
In order to make, synthesize, cook anything, you have to get it to the place where you will apply heat and other processes.  And then you distribute it to it's final destination.  And then again, it will likely move on from there at some point as well.
<br>

<br>
Transportation is critical.
<br>

<br>
Trombone spit valve corks are usually cork or rubber.  The rubber is also known as neoprene.  The screenshot at the bottom of this states that tire composition is more complex than one may realize.  It suggests that there is a 28% natural latex sap component to tires.  I've had a lot of cues in my envirnoment lately that seem to point to that being not only true, but the thing that will bring industrialism to a close mostly.
<br>

<br>
And because of that, we'll likely need to drastically decrease population unless we want huge populations to be extremely poor in the future.  It seems logical that if we reduce population voluntarily, in a liberty bell curve, then not only can we avoid that terrible fate, but our future generations will have an amazing technological world to live in.
<br>

<br>
But even with all our automation and technological advancements, we'll have to cut out a lot of physical work, not least of which is healthcare.  Sure, healthcare is here to stay, but we must go really light on it.  A much smaller population is not going to be too happy if they have to hold all the old people's hand while they are sick and dying.  There just won't be enough of them.
<br>

<br>
I don't have all the answers and I can't even prove this stuff.  But my story is incredibly sensational and it makes sense that this is the way the world is going.
