<b>Q: How am I supposed to help homeless people without any money?</b>  Can formerly homeless people who have made $1,000,000 in 35 years of working help other homeless people?
<br>

<br>
<b>Here's a little story for you....</b>  After the 2020 primary election, my finances were completely tapped out.  The pandemic was roaring.  I had run for US Rep in 2018 and 2020 on a platform that called for people to work from home if possible.  We got an apparently world wide test of ratcheting down industrialism, testing the global fiber optic network, and working from home.  Yet I got about 1% of the votes in 2018, 2020 and 2024.
<br>

<br>
After that 2020 election, I was in a panic.  My contract software business was not working out so well because of the demise of the ActionScript programming language.  I have always had a hard time getting software jobs because of my lack of a degree.  It seems that HR professionals and recruiting companies see you as a hard sell because of accountability, so they don't take the risk with you.
<br>

<br>
So I started my <b>Rand's Curry Kitchen LLC</b> by doing a ton of work and getting a Domestic Kitchen License with the USDA of Oregon.  I took out an SBA COVID Disaster Loan for $13,000.  I spent $3,000 on the business and $6,000 on a vehicle for it.  The business setup and licensing with the USDA was amazing.  My product was amazing.  But I was stopped again by sales.  My image, my advertising style or sensibilities.  Or underground fame.  Who knows what it is, right?
<br>

<br>
So then, I'm in a SUPER PANIC in the fall of 2020.  I take Sting's usual advice of "get out of your comfort zone" and with all the might I had, answered a Craigslist ad for a bass player and singer for a RUSH cover band.  We had a rehearsal and hit it off.  Personal dynamics and bad acoustics in the rehearsal room drove us apart almost instantly although all three of us obviously enjoyed playing together and our social dynamic.  Neither of them had played any gigs and I have played 2,000 gigs, yet they were not willing to take my advice on some technical things to do about our acoustics problem.
<br>

<br>
So, I went home, and working on transcribing RUSH songs on the piano and singing them with the Dot Trombone App on my iPad that I had coded in a mental hospital in the spring of 2009.  It worked great and within a few months, I was playing and singing about 20 RUSH songs and a few other songs on multiple instruments.  Although this did, kind of, get me out of my comfort zone, I had absolutely no intention of becoming a professional musician doing that kind of work.  I simply code software for a living.
<br>

<br>
Meanwhile, my gender transition had been ramping up behind the scenes since the fall of 2019.
<br>

<br>
This is all documented in my book <a target="rachel_lydia_rand" href="https://www.amazon.com/Log-Gender-Transition-Career-Revitalization-ebook/dp/B0CWYRBY8B/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LyVbfZUaIrufwtw2nB8tiBJsuIMrn8FIa6_tbmJUIhHAqxjqPWHKZlsaSzImntFz6fRrT5KkHeZrGw8WMZMeUA.Y10fykSZ3CMiOo-A07tiXOnC1CEOJgtD4XZdREuBu8c&dib_tag=se&keywords=rachel+lydia+rand&qid=1766662970&sr=8-3">The Log: Gender Transition and Career Revitalization in my 50's</a>
<br>

<br>
I wound up doing another full year of study with Microsoft server side languages in hopes of having a programming language that was viable enough to get a six figure job.  And I was successful with that, but it was crazy hard and barely worked.  Then I did even more "getting out of my comfort zone" and worked on being more social AFTER WORK, and that led to burnout at work, but did help with my political efforts.  Then Sting set a concert date in the spring of 2023 for Septmeber 26<sup>th</sup> 2023 which meant that I would be practicing that piano solo on <i>La Belle Dame Sans Regrets</i> again and be nervous about that.
<br>

<br>
I even took an ODOT physical for a CDL permit in the fall of 2024 after losing the DNC.  At the end of the physical, I talked with the doctor about my political runs.  He failed me for psychological reasons.  As he should have, because my politics are crazy advanced and I simply would not be good on the road long term.  <u>Or really any other job, including full time software engineering.</u>
<br>

<br>
I've done my best to reach out to book publishers.
<br>

<br>
I've done my best to reach out to politicians.
<br>

<br>
I've done my best.
<br>

<br>
Is it all my fault?  I have earned $150,000 playing music in the 1990's traveling around the world playing on 4 different continents.  I've made $1,000,000 coding software.  I have a string of blue collar jobs I have worked in a little bit.  Certainly way more than Joe Biden if the information I read on him is correct.
<br>

<br>
Is it my job to help the homeless?
<br>

<br>
Is it because of the color of my skin or the shape of my nose?
<br>

<br>
Is it because of my sex marker on my ID?
<br>

<br>
Is it just a dog eat dog world?  Am I simply not strong enough to be a female presenting US President?  Or  US Vice President?  Should we go with the Rand/Rand ticket?  Serious idea of course.
<br>

<b>Q: What does it mean to be an employee?</b>
<br>

<br>
A: Employees use their <u>service work</u> (a combination of physical and mental skills/actions) to produce value for their employer, whether they are a volunteer/contractor/FTE, so that the employer may realize a profit to pay the employee back, preferrably as quickly as possible, all things considered.

I'm a registered presidential principle campaign committee business with the IRS.  <b>EIN: 93-3331189</b>  I'm looking for employees who can get the job done.

Q: If you enjoy <i>24</i> and <i>Star Trek</i>, does that mean you <i>are</i> a man?  If you enjoy construction work does that mean you are a man?  Should I propose that all biological women stay at home, barefoot and pregnent?  Would that ease the gender tensions with me?

Between tattoos and t-shirt printing, society is a huge trigger for me.  If you react negatively to my authentic transgenderism, then maybe you should take a look at yourself and think from my perspective?

Miss Rand (aka [ m o t h ] 4, <i>Rachel</i>)
<br>

<br>
I enjoy this commander in chief job/training, but it is mostly based on the intellectualism of where the world is going, NOT DOING THE JOB ITSELF.  Kind of like <a target="rachel_lydia_rand" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_O'Connor#All_in_the_Family">Carrol O'Conner</a>.  I had read that he hated doing that role.  I know I hate some aspects of this presidential gig.
<br>

<br>
( When you are on a presidential level, people being tortured, murdered, killed in wars, takes on a whole different meaning than being an actor or musician.  It's different playing the part of someone sleeping on the cement in the snow than actually doing it for months and years. )

Uh, Merry Christmas!  (My family always celebrated on Christmas Eve.  Just my brother and my parents I think.)
<br>

<br>
So, let me guess or come up with a theory here about my little problem with total lack of campaign contributions....  Perhaps people are hesitant to contribute financially because I didn't form my company as a 501c3 non-profit because of the tax free status of their campaign contribution?  Perhaps they don't want to wind up in the finanical situation <u>Rachel is in</u> and really need to have that tax write off to be more like our President Trump with his rumored shady tax filings and bankruptcies?  It's like yes, Rachel did go through some sort of bankruptcy when she got out of the U.S. Navy in 2000, but she did it more in the "7 years of bad luck" way than the declare bankruptcy / pay what you can / get your credit re-established as quick as possible way.
<br>

<br>
I am quite skilled at business even though in some aspects of business, I'm almost completely lacking.  I'm certainly not very skilled at telling people "You're fired".  Hell, I have a hard time getting people to pay me months after they were supposed to.  It's like calling a liar out on lying.  Why bother?
<br>

<br>
But, I did manage to stay in business for well over a decade, paying my mortage on a $300,000 house with just me on the mortgage.  Some years earning just $30,000.  Yeah, it takes some budgeting skill and credit juggling to do that.  I had a phone conversation with Mark Gregory with his little SBA company earlier this year and he said "Yes, most people do not understand what it is like to be in business.  Having to deal with all of your income coming from random sales."  That's why I was so forgiving with my accounts receivable stuff.  Hey, the clients I have are typically not the main client.  I'm a sub-contractor.
<br>

<br>
<div class="indentedDark">
<br>
Perhaps there are some other gig economy workers out there who can relate to my business practices?  How many of them have been able to make it work for over a decade with a mortgage and dependent spouse who has no income?

<b>Very, very serious politics here folks:</b>
<br>

<br>
Q: If our industrial reality we live in has to do a drastic slowdown which results in:
<br>

<br>
1. 80% unemployment
<br>
2. 0% homelessness
<br>
3. 0% poverty
<br>
4. 5% non-commercial air traffic
<br>
5. a three tier system of gas rationing with the bottom tier being 1 gallon/week per car.
<br>
6. 6 bus day passes/month
<br>

<br>
What do you think these would look like:
<br>

<br>
1. Unions
<br>
2. Better Wages
<br>
3. Healthcare
<br>
4. Crime
<br>
5. Electronic communications
<br>
6. Sporting Events
<br>
7. Concerts
<br>
8. Churches
<br>

<br>

<br>
Why am I proposing this?  Because look around, we obviously can't remain this productive till the end of time.  Will it last another 100 years?  Exactly like this?  I've been spending massive amounts of time, while you have likely been taking care of your family and going to work, to figure out all these problems essentially 24/7 without pay.  I see the signs all around me on the streets and such.  The electrical wiring systems.  The automobile design.  The quality of our metals.  The way our electronics are evolving.
<br>

<br>
Please, please have a heart here and send some support for my massive efforts.  I've spent $26 in the last 9 months.  I'm at the brink of sanity and my health is failing.  It just feels cruel.  Homelessness is a crime against humanity at this point.
<br>

<br>

<br>
These electronics are amazingly cool.  You'll likely appreciate them more once air traffic and long distance automobile traffic go away mostly, right?  However you use them, whether you use them or not, please don't criticize people for using electronics/computers and being introverted.  We were all born into this special time at our individual age and family structures.  It's kind of like the song "Dancing in the Streets", but you know, don't force people to participate at gun point.
<br>

Like the signs around Portland say: 20 is plenty

Please have some compassion for me, and others.  I am a torture victim and the words "I Love You" were weaponized against me over 40 years ago.  Not even kidding about that.

There are many social peer pressure things that people do in our culture, through our music and media networks, <b>that shame people for running for president and being transgender</b>.  One example is Pink Floyd's lyric in their album <i>The Wall</i>: "Mother should I run for president?"  Another one is from Sting's <i>If I Ever Lose My Faith in You</i>: "You could say I, lost my belief in our politicians.  They all seemed like, game show hosts to me."
<br>

<br>
Of course those two hit home for me.  Both those bands/artists have anti gay lyrics too that are quite rude.  But, those are natural parts of the world we live in and MAY NOT completely hold water.
<br>

<br>
What would the world be like if we had 1,500 serious presidential candidates each election cycle?
<br>

<br>
What about publishing?  Are you rich enough to access an editor and publishing agent?  Do you have the family and business connnections?

I always, always identified as a "moderate / centrist" politically, didn't I?  So this little party change stuff is not a big deal, right?  I'm shopping around for support from other parties.  Contacted two so far.  Still working the problem.  Obviously.

I'm a registrered Republican now.  Apparently President Trump spent under one million dollars to become president last time and Biden and Harris had a billion dollars.  The idea there is that we are stopping mailing.  It's likely that mail will be a one or two day a thing in the future, but then again, who knows?  Well, I'd say one to two days a week makes sense.  No more red plum, right?  Just legal mail, presciptions.  We'll get it sorted out, right?

Uh, I pulled out the pocket constituion that I got at the VA HUDVASH CRRC office a few months ago to look something important up and what do you know?  It is just the US Constitution and does not have the most important part, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
<br>

<br>
It's the part about <u>running away from the Tyranny of the Christian World Order</u>.  My words of course.

Banking is a problem right now.  I've passed the FEC $5,000 threshold to be a candidate in 3 different election cycles (2018, 2020, 2024).

<br>

<b>The Public funding of presidential elections</b> is that checkbox, that $3 checkbox, that you see on your IRS 1040.  You have to raise $5,000 in $250 or less contributions in 20 of the 50 states (that totals to a minimum of $100,000) in order to qualify as a "serious candidate" who can access those funds.  There are a few people who did that in the 2024 election.  Here is the FEC page on it:

Running for president can be torturous hard work.  I've put some serious skin in the game.  I'd appreciate your vote of support.  It's not about me specificially winning an election.  It's about me being prepared to do the job itself.  We need a few people doing this crazy hard work so we have some people at the ready.  I need to eat too, right?  I need support and sales like anyone else.  I'm well developed.
<br>

<br>
thanks!

* do an fec.gov search for "rand".  Then click on the "VIEW MORE RESULTS" button.  Then filter by "president".  It comes up with 25 results.  Just 4 people passed the $5,000 FEC threshold to become a candidate.  Rachel Lydia Rand, Rand Paul, Randal Terry, and one other person who just barely went over.

These images are pointing to problems with housing and more importantly, transportation and energy.
<br>

<br>
In order to make, synthesize, cook anything, you have to get it to the place where you will apply heat and other processes.  And then you distribute it to it's final destination.  And then again, it will likely move on from there at some point as well.
<br>

<br>
Transportation is critical.
<br>

<br>
Trombone spit valve corks are usually cork or rubber.  The rubber is also known as neoprene.  The screenshot at the bottom of this states that tire composition is more complex than one may realize.  It suggests that there is a 28% natural latex sap component to tires.  I've had a lot of cues in my envirnoment lately that seem to point to that being not only true, but the thing that will bring industrialism to a close mostly.
<br>

<br>
And because of that, we'll likely need to drastically decrease population unless we want huge populations to be extremely poor in the future.  It seems logical that if we reduce population voluntarily, in a liberty bell curve, then not only can we avoid that terrible fate, but our future generations will have an amazing technological world to live in.
<br>

<br>
But even with all our automation and technological advancements, we'll have to cut out a lot of physical work, not least of which is healthcare.  Sure, healthcare is here to stay, but we must go really light on it.  A much smaller population is not going to be too happy if they have to hold all the old people's hand while they are sick and dying.  There just won't be enough of them.
<br>

<br>
I don't have all the answers and I can't even prove this stuff.  But my story is incredibly sensational and it makes sense that this is the way the world is going.
