This defines my interpretation of the US Presidential Executive function.  It talks about parenting, managing and teaching.  It should put to rest arguments of "grow up", unless those triggers in my environment are about some sexual dating thing, but this is politics of government and families, so I tend to be about the business of this.
<br>

<br>
The main point here is that I see myself, as the president, as a representative of Generation Z and will be confiring with them and <u>ordering</u> the EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT HEADS what to do based on my conferences with Generation Z representatives who WILL NOT BE on those executive branch cabinet positions.  I want those executive branch heads reporting to me what they are doing and what they are capable of doing.  I do not want them involved in the logic of what they are to do.  The logic of it is in my domain and I will be seeking people, starting with these HR/Research Assistant/Personal Assistant positions I have open, to work out the decisions of the thing.
<br>

<br>
Again, I see this as a clean break with Generation Z because of the population decline with the idea of setting them and their families, for those who have them, in places they can manage after this industrialism is all rusting away.  It'll likely be little communities scattered about in strategic places with minimal physical connection to each other.  Not sure what to think about the future of the rotting cities, but homelessness is a complete crime against humanity right now and my main mission IS TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE HOMELESSNESS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
<br>

<br>
Food is more complicated than homelessness.  The housing is there. Just move in.  The wires are just there, use them.  I'm not suggesting to break into housing illegally.  Support me as your president.  Send me a monetary CONTRIBUTION, and I will do everything I can so there will be an app to apply for better housing and eliminate all housing payments for everyone.  That mortgage/rent system will not work in a declining population and declining industrialism.  And neither will expanding healthcare and unions.  Management driving to work is on its way out as well.  Lots of changes.  Plenty of instructional videos.

I've changed my voter registration from DEM to Not a member of a party to REP.
<br>

<br>
Looking for support obviously.
<br>

<br>
I've got 3 open positons: HR, Research Assistant, Personal Assistant
<br>

<br>
Waiting for applicants.  Pay is ROOM AND BOARD to start with.  It's kind of a boot camp commander in chief thing like that.  <u>Looking to train people</u>.  I don't want some experienced person in here trying to do it their way with me in my inner inner circle.  I need a good researcher.  Collie and Nora are 28 years old and good like that.  You people are out there.  Reach out.  Apply.  Make a difference.

An example of a task I have for a <b>Research Assistant</b>:
<br>

<br>
<div class="indentedDark">
<br>
I have a list on the last iteration of my website of 2024 presidential candidates I copy and pasted from Ballotpedia.org.  I coded it into my politics.php page and then wrote some javascript to search it.  I've done some research lately that suggested that although there are like 1,333 candidates on that list, it appears that many candidates filed a FEC Form 2 Statement of Candidacy, but either failed to file a Form 3 or reported a much, much lower raising/spending threshold for candidacy than the $5,000 required by the FEC to File a Form 2 Statement of Candidacy.
<br>

<br>
So, just a couple minutes ago, I coded a button on each candidate on the list to link directly to them on the FEC.gov site and sure enough, the first two or three candidates on the list <b>DID NOT QUALIFY AS CANDIDATES</B> because they did not declare any spending/raising.
<br>

<br>
So I'd like to have a <b>Research Assistant</b> on board with me to follow up on that so we can get a good idea of how many candidate did run legitimately in 2024 and how I stacked up against them.  Perhaps I was in the top 40 of them after all?
<br>

<br>
</div>
<br>

<br>
I have a constant stream of projects like this.  It's always been part of my politics and would have been the first person I brought on board had I gotten elected.  Since I have not been elected yet and my politcs have advanced a lot, I'm bringing this person on board NOW because I simply have to much to do to do this myself now and I'm absolutely continuing with this effort.
<br>

Campaign Staff and Cabinet positions open.  No formal experience necessary.  Good research and logic skills to the top of the line.  Innocence is key with me as well and it's easier to lose as you get older.

OK, now for a little bit of politics....

These images are pointing to problems with housing and more importantly, transportation and energy.
<br>

<br>
In order to make, synthesize, cook anything, you have to get it to the place where you will apply heat and other processes.  And then you distribute it to it's final destination.  And then again, it will likely move on from there at some point as well.
<br>

<br>
Transportation is critical.
<br>

<br>
Trombone spit valve corks are usually cork or rubber.  The rubber is also known as neoprene.  The screenshot at the bottom of this states that tire composition is more complex than one may realize.  It suggests that there is a 28% natural latex sap component to tires.  I've had a lot of cues in my envirnoment lately that seem to point to that being not only true, but the thing that will bring industrialism to a close mostly.
<br>

<br>
And because of that, we'll likely need to drastically decrease population unless we want huge populations to be extremely poor in the future.  It seems logical that if we reduce population voluntarily, in a liberty bell curve, then not only can we avoid that terrible fate, but our future generations will have an amazing technological world to live in.
<br>

<br>
But even with all our automation and technological advancements, we'll have to cut out a lot of physical work, not least of which is healthcare.  Sure, healthcare is here to stay, but we must go really light on it.  A much smaller population is not going to be too happy if they have to hold all the old people's hand while they are sick and dying.  There just won't be enough of them.
<br>

<br>
I don't have all the answers and I can't even prove this stuff.  But my story is incredibly sensational and it makes sense that this is the way the world is going.
<br>
