This definitely plays into my basis of being a tradwife.  My first wife Ann joined the US Navy music program with the intent of becoming a conductor.  She had actually won an audition to be an Army band conductor.  She was dragging me down to Memphis to play with the Memphis Jazz Orcestra on Monday nights for three years.  I would have never done that if it wasn't for her.  Between sets, I was crazy uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
It's extremely easy to lead me around.  I've even seen 3 year olds push me around.  It doesn't mean that I can't lead though.  I'm crazy knowledgable about business.  I just have no money or position of power (yet).  But even with that power, my introversion is set in stone.<br>
<br>
So my strategy for the presidency is just to completely take charge and make it clear that I am commander in chief and this is not a committee.  If I am asking you questions, answer.  If not, keep your mouth shut.  And if I say to leave, leave.  We have the checks and balances up there that allow the president to be that one person.<br>
